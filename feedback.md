## **Code review**
- good readme with clear tasks division but missing some parts of it, I assume it's lack of time
- in main.py use if \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_main\_\_": instead of putting main() in the script (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-does-the-if-\_\_name\_\_-\_\_main\_\_-do/)
- some typing and docstring missing
- email_generator should be a class
- code is good but not enough OOP, it could be more elegant and modular
- Efficient and good project :fire: 


## **Presentation review**
- an overview visual for the entire workflow would have been nice
- nice prompt engineering, landing page and templates explanation
- good and meaningful dashboarding
- realistic improvements except the inhouse AI tool (not impossible but very complex)
- good and professional presentation!
